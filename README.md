## Channel Setup ðŸ“‹

The bot will automatically look for these channel names for welcome messages:
- `welcome`
- `general` 
- `welcomes`

Make sure you have at least one channel with one of these names, or the bot won't be able to send welcome messages.

## Customization ðŸŽ¨

You can customize the bot by editing `index.js`:

- **Welcome Message**: Modify the `welcomeEmbed` in the `guildMemberAdd` event
- **Channel Names**: Change the channel detection logic
- **Bot Status**: Update the activity message in the `ready` event
- **Colors**: Change the embed color (currently green: `#00ff00`)

## Troubleshooting ðŸ”§

### Bot Not Responding
- Make sure the bot token is correct in your `.env` file
- Check that the bot has proper permissions in your server
- Verify the bot is online in your server member list

### Welcome Messages Not Sending
- Ensure you have a channel named 'welcome', 'general', or 'welcomes'
- Check that the bot has permission to send messages in that channel
- Look at the console logs for error messages

### Permission Issues

- Verify the bot has "Send Messages" permission in the welcome channel
